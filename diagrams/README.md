## Internship Application Review Process (Sequence Diagrams)

This directory contains the UML Sequence Diagrams modeling the end-to-end process for a Company Representative (CR) to review and decide on whether to approve or reject an Internship Application within the system.

The core process is shown in one comprehensive diagram (main.png).

However, due to the complexity of the main diagram, I have broken it down into six smaller, interconnected diagrams for clarity and maintainability.
- Fetch internships by a specific company rep (subSeq_1.png)
- Select specific internship (subSeq_2.png)
- Fetch and filter applications for specific internship (subSeq_3.png)
- Select specific application (subSeq_4.png)
- Execute approval (subSeq_4a.png)
- Execute reject (subSeq_4b.png)

- ## Internship Application Class diagrams

- Consists of 3 class diagrams split into:
- Entity classes
- Repository classes
- Controller classes
